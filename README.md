## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#configure-this-project)Configure this project:
Open your console/terminal and run this: 
```sh
cd </your/desired/project/path/>
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cvera08/blockchain-automation.git
```

<!--- 
<sub> *// HINT: you can copy all these commands with a single click on the copy icon that will be displayed when you mouse over the console/code sections* </sub>

npm i
```

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#quick-run)Quick run:
[Please follow to this section â–¼](#run-tests-in-headless-mode-with-video-output-to-see-the-recording)
___

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#run-tests-in-uigui-mode)Run tests in UI/GUI mode:
By using your console/terminal, make sure you are in the right path and run this:
```sh
cd </your/desired/project/path>/blockchain-automation
npx cypress open
```
<sub> *// HINT: if the above command does not work for you, try this one instead:* 
>./node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open --e2e </sub>   

<br/>

After this:
- You may select "E2E Testing" (if it is not displayed is fine),
- Choose a browser (it will grab your local browser installations, you can choose Electron or any of them),
- Click "Start E2E Testing in \<yourSelectedBrowser>".

Now you are able to run the test/s by clicking on any *.cy.js* file.  
After you clicked on your desired spec file Cypress will start automatically the execution and after a while you will see the output results.

<sub>
// Once you are done with the execution, you can type ctrl+c in your terminal or close the browser runner and cypress window.
</sub>

<br/>
<br/>

**Demo open/GUI mode:**

**Troubleshooting GUI mode:**  

_If you face some error you need to be sure you are in the base project folder (blockchain-automation) and run 'npm install' again (make sure not to have errors or fix them according to the printed help)_.
>npm install

If it still does not work, try restarting all the involved programs (like Cypress/VS Code/etc), even your computer if it is necessary and start over again.

## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#run-tests-in-headless-mode-with-video-output-to-see-the-recording)Run tests in Headless mode (with video output to see the recording):
```sh
cd </your/project/path>/blockchain-automation
npx cypress run
```

<sub> *// HINT: if the above command does not work for you, try this one instead:* 
>./node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress run </sub>  

You will get something like this:

___
## [![](https://i.ibb.co/2kHmnLX/image.png)](#different-ways-to-use-cypress)Different ways to use Cypress:
Make sure you already are located on your project path before trying to run one/many of the following commands.
```sh
cd </your/project/path>/blockchain-automation
```
<br/>

They are ALL going to pursue the same goal:
>./node_modules/.bin/cypress open

>$(npm bin)/cypress open

>npx cypress open

>yarn run cypress open
